# Java Client-Server Chatting System

This project implements a simple client-server chatting application using Java.

It demonstrates:
- Socket Programming (TCP)
- Client-Server Architecture
- Multithreading
- Core Java and OOP concepts

The server handles multiple client connections and enables real-time message exchange between them.

This project marks the beginning of my development journey as a B.Tech CSE (Data Science & Analytics) student.
